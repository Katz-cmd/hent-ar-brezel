# üö® CRITICAL: Event Flooding Fix V2 - For Bundled JavaScript Sites

## ‚ö†Ô∏è URGENT: Your Site Still Has Event Flooding!

**Problem Identified**: Your website uses bundled JavaScript (`index-dckquwlz.js`) that has its own event tracking code. This bundled code was bypassing our previous deduplication fix.

## üîß NEW FIX APPLIED

### What We Just Did:
1. Created `pixel-dedup-override.js` - A global deduplication override
2. Updated `index.html` to load this script BEFORE everything else
3. This intercepts ALL Facebook Pixel calls, regardless of source

### How It Works:
```javascript
// The new override:
1. Intercepts window.fbq() globally
2. Intercepts fetch() calls to CAPI
3. Intercepts XMLHttpRequest calls
4. Blocks duplicates at ALL levels
5. Works with React, Vue, and other frameworks
```

## üìã DEPLOYMENT STEPS - DO THIS NOW!

### Step 1: Pull Latest Changes
```bash
git pull origin main
```

### Step 2: Ensure Both Files Are Deployed:
- ‚úÖ `index.html` (updated with script tag)
- ‚úÖ `pixel-dedup-override.js` (NEW FILE - MUST BE DEPLOYED!)

### Step 3: Clear All Caches
- Clear Cloudflare cache
- Clear CDN cache
- Clear browser cache

### Step 4: Verify in Browser Console
After deployment, you should see:
```
[FB Dedup] Initializing global deduplication override...
[FB Dedup] Facebook Pixel detected, installing override...
[FB Dedup] Override installed successfully
[FB Dedup] BLOCKED duplicate event: ViewContent
[FB Dedup] BLOCKED duplicate CAPI call: ViewContent
```

## üß™ TEST THE FIX

### In Browser Console, You Can:
```javascript
// Check deduplication stats
FB_DEDUP_CONTROL.getStats()

// Clear the cache if needed
FB_DEDUP_CONTROL.clearCache()

// Enable/disable debug messages
FB_DEDUP_CONTROL.setDebug(true)  // or false
```

## üîç WHAT TO LOOK FOR

### Before Fix (Current Problem):
```
CAPI Response: {success: true...}  // Repeated 10+ times
CAPI Response: {success: true...}
CAPI Response: {success: true...}
// Multiple responses for same event
```

### After Fix (Expected):
```
[FB Dedup] ‚úÖ Allowing event: ViewContent
CAPI Response: {success: true...}  // Only ONCE
[FB Dedup] BLOCKED duplicate event: ViewContent
[FB Dedup] BLOCKED duplicate CAPI call: ViewContent
// Duplicates are blocked
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL NOTES

1. **The file `pixel-dedup-override.js` MUST be deployed to your web root**
2. **It MUST load BEFORE your main JavaScript bundle**
3. **Clear ALL caches after deployment**
4. **Monitor Facebook Events Manager for reduced event volume**

## üÜò IF IT'S STILL NOT WORKING

Check these:
1. Is `pixel-dedup-override.js` accessible at `https://yourdomain.com/pixel-dedup-override.js`?
2. Does view-source of your site show `<script src="/pixel-dedup-override.js"></script>` BEFORE other scripts?
3. Are you seeing `[FB Dedup]` messages in console?
4. Try hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

## üìä EXPECTED RESULTS

Within 5 minutes of deployment:
- 90%+ reduction in duplicate events
- Clean event stream in Events Manager
- Console shows blocked duplicates
- CAPI responses drop from 10+ to 1 per event

## üî¥ THIS IS CRITICAL

Your site is currently flooding Facebook with duplicate events. This can:
- Mess up your ad targeting
- Increase costs
- Get your pixel flagged
- Reduce ad performance

**DEPLOY THIS FIX IMMEDIATELY!**
